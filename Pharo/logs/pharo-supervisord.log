  2. Put the name of the image file on the command line when you
     run pharo (use the `-help' option for more information).
  3. Set the environment variable PHARO_IMAGE to the name of the image
     that you want to use by default.

pthread_setschedparam failed: Operation not permitted
This VM uses a separate heartbeat thread to update its internal clock
and handle events.  For best operation, this thread should run at a
higher priority, however the VM was unable to change the priority.  The
effect is that heavily loaded systems may experience some latency
issues.  If this occurs, please create the appropriate configuration
file in /etc/security/limits.d/ as shown below:

cat <<END | sudo tee /etc/security/limits.d/pharo.conf
*      hard    rtprio  2
*      soft    rtprio  2
END

and report to the pharo mailing list whether this improves behaviour.

You will need to log out and log back in for the limits to take effect.
